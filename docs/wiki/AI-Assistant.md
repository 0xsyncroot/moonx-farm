1. **Navigate to Swap**: Click the 'Swap' tab in the main interface
2. **Select Tokens**: 
   - From: ETH (should be pre-selected)

4. **Review Quote**: I'll show you the best rate from multiple aggregators
5. **Execute**: Click 'Swap' to complete the transaction

Would you like me to walk you through this live, or do you have questions about any specific step?"

#### Advanced Strategy Discussion
**User**: "What's the best DCA strategy for ETH?"

**Lili**: "Great question! DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) is an excellent strategy for ETH. Based on your portfolio and current market conditions, here's what I recommend:

**Optimal DCA Setup for ETH:**
- **Amount**: $100-500 per week (adjust based on your budget)
- **Frequency**: Weekly (smooths out volatility better than daily)
- **Duration**: 12-24 weeks (covers multiple market cycles)
- **Price Limits**: Set 20% above/below current price for safety

**Current Market Context:**
- ETH is at $2,100 (down 15% from recent highs)
- Volatility is moderate (good for DCA entry)
- Gas fees are reasonable for regular purchases

**Risk Considerations:**
- Start with smaller amounts to test the strategy
- Consider market events (ETF approvals, upgrades)
- Keep 20% cash for dip opportunities

Would you like me to help you set up a DCA strategy right now?"

### Educational Support

#### DeFi Concept Explanation
**User**: "What is impermanent loss?"

**Lili**: "Impermanent loss is a key concept in DeFi that every trader should understand! Let me break it down:

**Simple Explanation:**
Impermanent loss occurs when you provide liquidity to a pool and the price ratio of your deposited tokens changes compared to just holding them.

**Real Example:**
1. You deposit 1 ETH + 2000 USDC in a 50/50 pool
2. ETH price doubles from $2000 to $4000
3. Pool rebalances: you now have ~0.707 ETH + ~2828 USDC
4. If you just held: 1 ETH + 2000 USDC = $6000
5. Pool value: 0.707 ETH + 2828 USDC = $5656
6. Impermanent loss: $344 (5.7%)

**Key Points:**
- Loss is 'impermanent' - it disappears if prices return to original ratio
- Fees from trading can offset impermanent loss
- Higher volatility = higher potential loss
- Different pool ratios (80/20) can reduce impact

**On MoonXFarm:**
We show impermanent loss calculations for any LP positions in your portfolio analytics.

### Market Analysis

#### Price Analysis Request
**User**: "Should I buy ETH now?"

**Lili**: "Let me analyze the current ETH market conditions for you:

**Current ETH Analysis (Real-time):**
- **Price**: $2,085 (-3.2% today)
- **24h Volume**: $12.8B (above average)
- **Support Level**: $2,050 (strong buying interest)
- **Resistance**: $2,150 (previous support, now resistance)

**Technical Indicators:**
- **RSI**: 42 (approaching oversold, bullish signal)
- **Moving Averages**: Price below 20-day, above 50-day (mixed signals)
- **Volume Profile**: Increasing on dips (accumulation pattern)

**Fundamental Factors:**
- **Staking Yield**: 3.8% (attractive for long-term holders)
- **Network Activity**: Transaction fees stable, network healthy
- **Upcoming Events**: Dencun upgrade optimism

**My Recommendation:**
Given your risk profile and portfolio, this could be a good entry point. Consider:
1. **DCA Strategy**: $200/week for 8 weeks instead of lump sum
2. **Target Range**: $2,050-2,100 for accumulation
3. **Take Profit**: 25% at $2,400, 50% at $2,800

**Risk Factors:**
- Market uncertainty around macro events
- Potential ETF selling pressure
- Keep 30% cash for further dips

Would you like me to help set up a DCA strategy or limit orders?"
